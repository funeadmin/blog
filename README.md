various features:  
I want to create a blog site, and bio for myself, and I want to have a place where my wife can share places we have traveled to, as well as share images. 
  
Various endpoints:  This will be a work in progress, I want to copy the workflow used for the twitter assignment back in SQL class. 
As I dive back in forth I will continue to add. For now, I will add the below:  
 base_url/Users : GET : liking_shouts 
            : DEL delete 
            : POST create 
 base_url/Shouts: GET : liking_users 
                             : DEL delete 
                             : POST create 
base_url/articles
